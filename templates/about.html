        <h2>What is the social network of informal collaboration?</h2>
        <p>The social network of informal collaboration in financial economics shows how financial economists work together. Academics frequently discuss their work with their colleagues: at conferences, when holding a visiting position at another department, or in casual discussions with other faculty members around the water cooler.</p>
        <p>They exchange new ideas, point to emerging trends, share new literature and critize each others work, all of which can be subsumed as social informal collaboration. Typically, authors acknowledge informal collaboration in a separate footnote in a published article. We use these acknowledgements to create the social network of informal collaboration in financial economics. It links authors and acknowledged commenters by undirected and weighted links. The network allows us to study network effects and the dissemation of information in a large scientific setting.</p>
        <p>We set up this website because we thought our colleagues might be interested to learn about patterns of informal collaboration and see where they are in our data. And of course because we had fun setting up the website.</p>
