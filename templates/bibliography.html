        <h2>Georg, Co-Pierre and Rose, Michael E.: The Importance of Informal Intellectual Collaboration with Central Colleagues</h2>
        <p>Co-authorship is a form of formal intellectual collaboration in academia and is well researched. But most intellectual collaboration among academics, for example the provision of helpful commentary on a colleague’s manuscript, is informal and not well understood. In this paper, we study social network effects in informal intellectual collaboration in financial economics. We reconstruct the social network of financial economics from formal and informal collaboration among financial economists using a novel and unique hand-collected dataset based on all publications in six leading journals in financial economics from 1997-2011. Our hypothesis is that informally collaborating with a colleague who is more central in the social network of financial economics improves the scientific impact of a research article. Treating the assignment of discussants at NBER summer institutes as quasi-natural experiment, we show that an increase in the discussant’s eigenvector centrality by ten ranks from the mean is associated with 15 more citations for an average research article.</p>

        <h2>Georg, Co-Pierre and Rose, Michael E.: Mirror, Mirror, on the Wall, Who is the Most Central of Them all?</h2>
        <p>We examine the flow information in financial economics with respect to influential researchers. We proxy influence in the profession with different centrality measures in a social network connecting authors and acknowledged commenters of 6406 full research articles published between 1997 and 2011. More cited researchers tend to rank higher according to eigenvector centrality, but less so over time. Contrary to widespread belief, citation and publication stock correlate weakly with being acknowledged often. Giving and receiving comments furthermore vary with the academic life cycle. Our ranking hence provide a new way to measure influence.</p>
